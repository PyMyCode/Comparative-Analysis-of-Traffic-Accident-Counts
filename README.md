This study examines traffic accident counts across the United States at the state, multi-city, and single-city levels using
multiple statistical modeling approaches. The exposure-adjusted state-level analysis using Negative Binomial Regression
model reveals that structural and environmental factors, rather than individual crash behaviors, account for most of
the variation in fatality risk per mile across states. In predicting daily crash counts in multi-city level analysis of New
York, San Francisco and Chicago combined, Negative Binomial model outperformed Poisson and Quasi Poisson models,
using predictors of road conditions, lighting conditions and time-of-day factors, while weather situation degraded model
performance when used in conjunction with the same subset of variables. For the city of Los Angeles, public holidays
and accident location emerged as the most influential predictors of accident frequency. Notably, and in contrast to earlier
research, the square-root–transformed multiple linear regression model demonstrated a superior empirical fit and higher
predictive performance compared with the Poisson model. At the New York City level, we examine how active street
construction relates to motor-vehicle crash counts. Using 2023 NYC Open Data and a Negative Binomial count model
with a length offset, we find that segments with active construction have about 3.6 times as many crashes per kilometer per
month as comparable non-construction segments, highlighting work zones on major corridors as priority targets for safety
interventions.
